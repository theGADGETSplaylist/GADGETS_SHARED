1) Most parts printed with 3 wall counts and 30% unfill.

2) A 470µF electroltytic capacitor was added across MP1584 output to absorb ESP32 current spikes during communication.

3) Real world rotors can be balanced with mandrels using tubing or treaded rod as core and 3D printed adapters to hold component to it.

4) CLEAR "sine" like waveforms are crucial to balancing with HS-ACC. I used the following settings:

10 Hz to 30 Hz Low Pass Filter  3rd ORDER

5) Adjust E18-D80NK potentiometer for best reference

6) You'll find STLs for IR bracket options using heavy gauge coat hanger wire. Wire is bent sharply 180º unto itself for about 13mm and inserted into brackets.

7) IDLER BEAM and MOTOR TRACK have been modified (after video release). Use 1/4-20 thread inserts in idler beam end.

8) Firmware update (after #156 video release) has inverted (corrected) G polarity. Now opposite to that stated at the 4:45 timestamp. RJ45 lock tab to point up on right pedestal.

ENJOY:)
